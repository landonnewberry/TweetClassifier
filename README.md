# TweetClassifier
Used Word2Vec and sklearn SVMs to classify tweets. In this example, all train/test tweets contain the keyword landslide. Based on labeled training set, the classifier is able to determine whether or not the tweet is referencing a natural disaster rather than quoting a song or a political landslide.
